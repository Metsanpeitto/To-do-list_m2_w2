## Learning objectives

- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.

### Instructions

- Deploy your website using GitHub Pages.
- Update the README of your repository to include a link to the online version.

=======

## Built With 

- HTML/CSS
- Node.JS

=======

## Getting Started

If you want to visit the deployed app just visit the following link: 

- [`https://metsanpeitto.github.io/To-do-list_m2_w2/`](https://metsanpeitto.github.io/To-do-list_m2_w2/)

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it

- [`git clone https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/To-do-list_m2_w2`](https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/To-do-list_m2_w2)

After cloning it you can see the project opening the index.html file with your favorite browser ( Firefox for example )


### Project requirements

- Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
- Create an **index.html** file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty **To Do List** placeholder (`<div>` or `<ul>` element). The **index.html** file must be set as a template using the *HTML Webpack Plugin*.
- Create an **index.js** file and set an array of some simple *to do tasks* (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: 
  1. description [`string`].
  2. completed [`bool`].
  3. index: [`number`].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should apear in order of the `index` values for each task.
- Create a **style.css** and set rules for the **To Do List**. CSS must be loaded by *Webpack Style/CSS Loader*. Your list should looks like the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.

[![Capstone intro](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AcUd-_Yjjqg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUd-_Yjjqg)
- All your source files (**index.html**, **index.js** and **style.css**) must be located in */src* directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by *webpack dev server* from */dist* folder.


### Prerequisites

- Node.JS
