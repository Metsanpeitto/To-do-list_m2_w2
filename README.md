## Learning objectives

- Write units tests for a JavaScript app.


### Project requirements
- Create a test file(s) (`[..].test.js`) for a file(s) containing the following functions:
    - a function for editing the task description.
    - a function for updating an item's 'completed' status.
    - a function for updating an item's index value upon drag/drop actions.
    - the "Clear all completed" function.
- Use the mock storage object you have created in Part 1 of this project to mock the *localStorage* updates.
- Mock the HTML elements to test DOM manipulation functions.
- Make sure you group your tests using the `description()` method.
-  **You need to use pair-programming for this project. We will check to see if both partners submitted code by looking at the commit history for each project.  Therefore you need to select one of the repos in your pair-programming group in which you will implement the above features.**
