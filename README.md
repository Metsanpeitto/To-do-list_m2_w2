## Learning objectives

- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.

### Project requirements
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use `filter()` method).
- By default new tasks should have the property `completed` set to `false` and the property `index` set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.
